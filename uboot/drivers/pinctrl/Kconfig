config PINCTRL
	bool "Support pin controllers"
	depends on DM
	help
	  This enables the basic support for pinctrl framework.  You may want
	  to enable some more options depending on what you want to do.

config PINCTRL_FULL
	bool "Support full pin controllers"
	depends on PINCTRL && OF_CONTROL
	default n
	help
	  This provides Linux-compatible device tree interface for the pinctrl
	  subsystem.  This feature depends on device tree configuration because
	  it parses a device tree to look for the pinctrl device which the
	  peripheral device is associated with.

	  If this option is disabled (it is the only possible choice for non-DT
	  boards), the pinctrl core provides no systematic mechanism for
	  identifying peripheral devices, applying needed pinctrl settings.
	  It is totally up to the implementation of each low-level driver.
	  You can save memory footprint in return for some limitations.

config PINCTRL_GENERIC
	bool "Support generic pin controllers"
	depends on PINCTRL_FULL
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the pinctrl subsystem through the
	  generic DT interface.  If enabled, some functions become available
	  to parse common properties such as "pins", "groups", "functions" and
	  some pin configuration parameters.  It would be easier if you only
	  need the generic DT interface for pin muxing and pin configuration.
	  If you need to handle vendor-specific DT properties, you can disable
	  this option and implement your own set_state callback in the pinctrl
	  operations.

config PINMUX
	bool "Support pin multiplexing controllers"
	depends on PINCTRL_GENERIC
	default n
	help
	  This option enables pin multiplexing through the generic pinctrl
	  framework. Most SoCs have their own own multiplexing arrangement
	  where a single pin can be used for several functions. An SoC pinctrl
	  driver allows the required function to be selected for each pin.
	  The driver is typically controlled by the device tree.

config PINCONF
	bool "Support pin configuration controllers"
	depends on PINCTRL_GENERIC
	help
	  This option enables pin configuration through the generic pinctrl
	  framework.

config SPL_PINCTRL
	bool "Support pin controlloers in SPL"
	depends on SPL && SPL_DM
	help
	  This option is an SPL-variant of the PINCTRL option.
	  See the help of PINCTRL for details.

config SPL_PINCTRL_FULL
	bool "Support full pin controllers in SPL"
	depends on SPL_PINCTRL && SPL_OF_CONTROL
	default y
	help
	  This option is an SPL-variant of the PINCTRL_FULL option.
	  See the help of PINCTRL_FULL for details.

config SPL_PINCTRL_GENERIC
	bool "Support generic pin controllers in SPL"
	depends on SPL_PINCTRL_FULL
	default y
	help
	  This option is an SPL-variant of the PINCTRL_GENERIC option.
	  See the help of PINCTRL_GENERIC for details.

config SPL_PINMUX
	bool "Support pin multiplexing controllers in SPL"
	depends on SPL_PINCTRL_GENERIC
	default y
	help
	  This option is an SPL-variant of the PINMUX option.
	  See the help of PINMUX for details.
	  The pinctrl subsystem can add a substantial overhead to the SPL
	  image since it typically requires quite a few tables either in the
	  driver or in the device tree. If this is acceptable and you need
	  to adjust pin multiplexing in SPL in order to boot into U-Boot,
	  enable this option. You will need to enable device tree in SPL
	  for this to work.

config SPL_PINCONF
	bool "Support pin configuration controllers in SPL"
	depends on SPL_PINCTRL_GENERIC
	help
	  This option is an SPL-variant of the PINCONF option.
	  See the help of PINCONF for details.

config AR933X_PINCTRL
	bool "QCA/Athores ar933x pin control driver"
	depends on DM && SOC_AR933X
	help
	  Support pin multiplexing control on QCA/Athores ar933x SoCs.
	  The driver is controlled by a device tree node which contains
	  both the GPIO definitions and pin control functions for each
	  available multiplex function.

config QCA953X_PINCTRL
	bool "QCA/Athores qca953x pin control driver"
	depends on DM && SOC_QCA953X
	help
	  Support pin multiplexing control on QCA/Athores qca953x SoCs.
	  The driver is controlled by a device tree node which contains
	  both the GPIO definitions and pin control functions for each
	  available multiplex function.

config ROCKCHIP_PINCTRL
	bool "Rockchip pin control driver"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Support pin multiplexing control on Rockchip SoCs. The driver is
	  controlled by a device tree node which contains both the GPIO
	  definitions and pin control functions for each available multiplex
	  function.

config ROCKCHIP_3036_PINCTRL
	bool "Rockchip rk3036 pin control driver"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Support pin multiplexing control on Rockchip rk3036 SoCs. The driver is
	  controlled by a device tree node which contains both the GPIO
	  definitions and pin control functions for each available multiplex
	  function.

config PINCTRL_SANDBOX
	bool "Sandbox pinctrl driver"
	depends on SANDBOX
	help
	  This enables pinctrl driver for sandbox.  Currently, this driver
	  actually does nothing but print debug messages when pinctrl
	  operations are invoked.

config PIC32_PINCTRL
	bool "Microchip PIC32 pin-control and pin-mux driver"
	depends on DM && MACH_PIC32
	default y
	help
	  Supports individual pin selection and configuration for each remappable
	  peripheral available on Microchip PIC32 SoCs. This driver is controlled
	  by a device tree node which contains both GPIO defintion and pin control
	  functions.

config SFAX8_PINCTRL
    bool "Sfax8 pin control driver"
	depends on DM
	help
		Support pin multiplexing control on sfax8 SoCs. The driver is
		controlled by a device tree node which contains both the GPIO
		definitions and pin control functions for each available multiplex
		function.

config SFA28_PINCTRL
    bool "Sfa28 pin control driver"
	depends on DM
	help
		Support pin multiplexing control on sfax8 SoCs. The driver is
		controlled by a device tree node which contains both the GPIO
		definitions and pin control functions for each available multiplex
		function.
