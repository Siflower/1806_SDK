config TIMER
	bool "Enable driver model for timer drivers"

	help
	  Enable driver model for timer access. It uses the same API as

	  counter. There may be no real tick, and no timer interrupt.

config TIMER_EARLY
	bool "Allow timer to be used early in U-Boot"

	  execution before driver model is set up. Enable this option to
	  use an early timer. These functions must be supported by your timer
	  driver: timer_early_get_count() and timer_early_get_rate().
