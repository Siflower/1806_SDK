The chosen node
---------------
The chosen node does not represent a real device, but serves as a place
for passing data like which serial device to used to print the logs etc


stdout-path property
--------------------
Device trees may specify the device to be used for boot console output
with a stdout-path property under /chosen.

Example
-------
/ {
	chosen {
		stdout-path = "/serial@f00:115200";
	};

	serial@f00 {
		compatible = "vendor,some-uart";
		reg = <0xf00 0x10>;
	};
};

tick-timer property
-------------------
In a system there are multiple timers, specify which timer to be used
as the tick-timer. Earlier it was hardcoded in the timer driver now
since device tree has all the timer nodes. Specify which timer to be
used as tick timer.

Example
-------
/ {
	chosen {
		tick-timer = "/timer2@f00";
	};

	timer2@f00 {
		compatible = "vendor,some-timer";
		reg = <0xf00 0x10>;
	};
};
