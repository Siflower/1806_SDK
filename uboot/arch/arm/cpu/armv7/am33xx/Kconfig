	help
	  This option specifies support for the AM43xx
	  GP and HS EVM development platforms.The AM437x
	  GP EVM is a standalone test, development, and
	  evaluation module system that enables developers
	  to write software and develop hardware around
	  an AM43xx processor subsystem.

config ISW_ENTRY_ADDR
	hex "Address in memory or XIP flash of bootloader entry point"
	help
	  After any reset, the boot ROM on the AM43XX SOC
	  searches the boot media for a valid boot image.
	  For non-XIP devices, the ROM then copies the
	  image into internal memory.
	  For all boot modes, after the ROM processes the
	  boot image it eventually computes the entry
	  point address depending on the device type
	  (secure/non-secure), boot media (xip/non-xip) and
	  image headers.

config PUB_ROM_DATA_SIZE
	hex "Size in bytes of the L3 SRAM reserved by ROM to store data"
	help
	  During the device boot, the public ROM uses the top of
	  the public L3 OCMC RAM to store r/w data like stack,
	  heap, globals etc. When the ROM is copying the boot
	  image from the boot media into memory, the image must
	  not spill over into this area. This value can be used
	  during compile time to determine the maximum size of a
	  boot image. Once the ROM transfers control to the boot
	  image, this area is no longer used, and can be reclaimed
	  for run time use by the boot image.
